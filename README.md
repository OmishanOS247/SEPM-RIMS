# Student Examination Preparator Module (Front-end only)
This project is an add-on module to my graduation college's main website, i.e., [https://rimsedu.ac.in/](url).
The module provides the facilities for the college students to get help in their preparations for the examinations being conducted in the College, such as Internals and Semesters.
The main feature of this module is providing Previous Year Questions as a help to the students.
Along with it the other features are:  
- Downloadable Previous Year Questions in form of .pdf files.
- Answers to the Previous Year Questions.
- Mini Discussion Forum for Students for being able to discuss their answers with respect to the question paper.

Technologies used for developing the front-end are:
- HTML
- CSS

This module's front-end is developed by a 5-membered group during our BCA Final Year (Rourkela Institute of Management Studies, Rourkela; Batch 2019-2022):
- **Omishan Upadhyay (Team Leader)**
- Raj Nandni Karua
- Anmol Hatua
- Monalisa Pradhan
- Pujarani Biswal
